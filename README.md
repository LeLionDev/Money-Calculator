# Money Calculator
This is a command line tool to allow users to input their 'spendings' to build a database of history to calculate user's spendings.

Current plan is to calculate within the ranges from monthly to yearly and output savings per month based on the inputs given.

No tax calculation.. yet.

#TODO
- storing user input to reasonable location with suitable format for data manipulation
- print database for human readable format for assessment of user's spending
- default filtering/tags of expenditures (stretch)
